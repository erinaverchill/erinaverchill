- 👋 Hi, I’m Erin
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how big data and machine learning can *actually* make the world a better place, while being candid and proactive about its risks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build machine learning models using TensorFlow, and taking a Discrete Math course through Coursera.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to journalism, plants/nature, education, social mobility, or city planning
- 📫 How to reach me: averillerin@gmail.com
